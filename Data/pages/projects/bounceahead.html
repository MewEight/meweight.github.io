        My first project where I had to organize and coordinate my team to make sure 
        we can completed the project in time. The team was around 5 people.
        <br>
        <br>
        I wrote all the base system for the game. Example include, save system, unlocking system, enemy logic, 
        and animation tweens.
        <br>
        <br>
        We won a grant from our local goverment to continue developing the project.
