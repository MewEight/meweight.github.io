        My first project when I joined the company. Praised for my quick iteration times and
        ability to learn and adapt to the company standard.
        <br>
        <br>
        I wrote a level editor to easily create level and prototype levels. 
        I also implemented AI system for the enemies.
        <br>
        <br>
        Optimized the game to make sure the game runs smooth even with the many enemies and bullets.
