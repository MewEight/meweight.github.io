        My first project when I joined the company. 
        Assigned the project for my internship and completed it within 9 months.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was the solo developer and had design guidance by other senior designers. 
        Ported the original idea from another game and engine.
        <br>
        <br>
        Did all the animations in game as well as polishing them.
