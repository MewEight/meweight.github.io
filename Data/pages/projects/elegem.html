        My first godot project that I released after wanting to learn how to use the godot engine. 
        I have always liked puzzle game and am finally able to launch a puzzle game with a mechanic 
        I rarely see.
        <br>
        <br>
        I drew and implemented everything. This also gave me the opportunity to enjoy something 
        I really like to do as well which is pixel art.
        <br>
        <br>
        I learned to write shaders as well.
